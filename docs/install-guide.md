# Installing Maison Panel — the plain-English guide

This walks through everything needed to go from "code on GitHub" to "dashboard glowing on the
wall." No coding required for this part — Phases 1 (weather) and 2 (solunar) work with zero API
keys, so you can get the panel live today.

There are two parts:

1. **Put the website online** (done once, from any computer) — 10 minutes.
2. **Set up the tablet** (done once, on the tablet itself) — 15 minutes.

## Part 1 — Put the website online (Cloudflare Workers)

Think of this step as: "take the code and give it a real web address." Right now the code just
sits in GitHub; it isn't a website yet. Cloudflare's dashboard now onboards new static sites
through its **Workers** flow (Pages and Workers have merged) — it reads the code and turns it into
`https://something.workers.dev` that the tablet can open.

1. Go to **[dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com)** and log in (Kevin already has an
   account from `cpt-ai.pages.dev`).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Workers & Pages**.
3. Click **Create** → **Connect to Git**.
4. If GitHub isn't connected yet, click **Connect GitHub** and approve it. Since the repo is
   **private**, make sure you grant Cloudflare access to `kevincaron28/Maison-Panel` specifically
   (either "all repositories" or pick it from the list).
5. Select the **Maison-Panel** repository, then click **Begin setup**.
6. Pick the branch to deploy — **`main`**, the branch that should always be live on the wall.
7. Build settings — this project has **no build step**, but Cloudflare's Workers flow still asks
   for two fields:
   - **Build command**: leave **blank**
   - **Deploy command**: `npx wrangler deploy` — the repo already has a `wrangler.toml` telling
     Cloudflare to serve the whole repo as static files, no Worker script needed
8. Click **Deploy**. Wait about 30–60 seconds.
9. Cloudflare gives you a URL like `https://maison-panel.kevincaron28.workers.dev`. **Write this
   URL down** — the tablet needs it in Part 2. On the project's **Domains** tab, make sure the
   **Production** toggle next to that URL is switched **on** — that's what actually makes it public.
10. Open that URL in any browser (your phone, your laptop). You should see: a clock, today's
    weather, and a moon phase under "Pêche." That means it worked.

From now on, any time new code is pushed to the `main` branch, Cloudflare automatically rebuilds
and updates that same URL within about a minute — no redeploying by hand.

## Part 2 — Set up the tablet

This part turns a normal Android tablet into a wall panel that only ever shows this one page,
never sleeps, and never lets anyone accidentally swipe away from it.

### 2.1 Install the kiosk app

1. On the tablet, open the **Play Store**.
2. Search for **Fully Kiosk Browser** and install it (free version is enough to start).
3. Open the app once it's installed.

### 2.2 Point it at your panel

1. In Fully Kiosk Browser, open **Settings** (usually a long-press on the screen, or the menu
   icon) → **Web Content Settings** → **Start URL**.
2. Paste in the `workers.dev` URL from Part 1.
3. Go back to the main screen — it should now load the panel.

### 2.3 Make it behave like a real wall panel, not a browser

Still inside Fully Kiosk Browser's settings, turn these on (names may vary slightly by version):

| Setting | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Fullscreen / Kiosk mode** | Motion & Kiosk Mode | hides the Android status bar and nav buttons |
| **Enable Start URL on boot** | General | panel comes back automatically after a power cut |
| **Screen always on** | Device Management | tablet never goes to sleep |
| **Disable pull-to-refresh** | Web Content Settings | stops an accidental swipe from reloading the page |
| **Disable long-press context menu** | Web Content Settings | stops an accidental long-press popping up a menu |
| **Motion-detect screen wake** *(if tablet has a front camera)* | Motion & Kiosk Mode | wakes the screen when someone walks by |

If the app asks to become a **Device Admin** or a **Home/Launcher app**, say yes — that's what
lets it block the regular Android home button and stay in full kiosk mode.

### 2.4 Tablet-wide settings (in Android's own Settings app, not Fully Kiosk)

1. **Display → Auto-rotate**: turn off, and lock to **landscape**.
2. **Apps → Play Store**: turn off auto-updates (Settings → Network preferences → Auto-update
   apps → Don't auto-update apps). You don't want an app update popping a dialog over the panel
   at 3am.
3. **Notifications**: turn off notifications for every app you can — a message popup on the wall
   panel looks broken even if it isn't.
4. **Battery**: if the tablet has a "charge limit" option (some Samsung/Lenovo tablets do), set it
   to around **80%**. A tablet charging at 100% forever, permanently plugged in, wears the battery
   out in a year or two. If there's no such setting, just budget for eventually replacing the
   battery — it's a consumable in this setup, not a defect.

### 2.5 Mount it

1. Plan the power cable route **before** you drill anything — this is much harder to fix after the
   tablet is on the wall.
2. Mount the tablet in **landscape** orientation.
3. Plug it in, and leave it plugged in permanently (that's what the 80% charge limit above is
   protecting against).

That's it — the panel should now be live on the wall, updating the clock every few seconds,
weather every 15 minutes, and the moon/fishing info every 5 minutes, entirely on its own.

## Checking it's working

- **Weather looks wrong / blank**: it'll say "updated HH:MM" in a dimmed color if it's showing an
  old cached reading because the live fetch failed — that's expected behavior, not a bug (see
  `CLAUDE.md` — every tile is designed to degrade gracefully rather than go blank).
- **Whole panel is blank/white**: that means the page itself didn't load — double check the Start
  URL in Fully Kiosk Browser matches the `workers.dev` address exactly.
- **Panel looks right but is stuck on an old version**: on the tablet, in Fully Kiosk Browser,
  there's a manual **Reload Start URL** action in the settings/menu — or just wait, since the
  panel auto-reloads itself once a day at 3am anyway (`config.js` → `dailyReloadHour`).

## Turning on calendar and markets

Weather and solunar work with zero setup. Calendar and markets are both configured now too — here's
what each still needs from the tablet side to actually show anything.

**Calendar** — built as a private embed, so nothing needs to be made public. `config.js` →
`calendar.calendarId` is already set to Kevin's Google account. The one remaining step is on the
tablet: sign into that same Google account in Fully Kiosk Browser (Settings → there's a "manage
Google account" / normal Chrome-engine sign-in flow — it's the same as signing into Chrome on any
Android device). The calendar tile only shows events while that sign-in holds.

If it ends up looking too much like a plain Google Calendar widget bolted onto the panel (it will —
that's the trade-off for keeping it private), the fallback is Path A in `docs/project-brief.md`
§5.3: make a calendar public and switch `calendar.mode` to `"api"` for full styling control.

**Markets** — uses Financial Modeling Prep (`config.js` → `markets.fmpKey`, already set), not
Finnhub — free Finnhub turned out to be delayed/inconsistent in practice despite its marketing, and
FMP's free tier is honestly the same shape (end-of-day, not live intraday). Nothing more to do here
for now; genuinely live quotes are planned to route through the speaker bridge (see `/server`) once
the PC/Pi is set up.

## Camera — not yet

Camera hardware hasn't been bought yet, so there's nothing to configure — `config.js` →
`camera.enabled` stays `false` until it is. See `docs/project-brief.md` §11.2 for what's needed
once a camera's picked (brand/model decides whether snapshot polling is even possible).

## Speaker control — needs a PC or Raspberry Pi running

This is the one tile that isn't purely "code on Cloudflare" — controlling Google Home speakers
needs a real always-on helper on your home network (a browser can't do it alone). Full setup is in
[`server/README.md`](../server/README.md); short version:

1. On a PC (or later a Raspberry Pi) on the same Wi-Fi as the speakers: `cd server && npm install && npm start`.
2. Put that machine's LAN address into `config.js` → `speakers.bridgeUrl`, and `speakers.enabled: true`.
3. On the tablet, in Fully Kiosk Browser, turn on **"Allow insecure content"** — the panel is
   `https://` but this helper is plain `http://` on the LAN, and browsers block mixing the two by
   default. Same reason the camera tile needs this too.

Unlike the other tiles, this one needs that PC (or Pi) turned on and running `npm start` to work at
all — if it's off, the speaker tile just quietly disappears, same as everything else here failing
gracefully.

## Changing settings later (location, units, etc.)

Everything tunable lives in one file: **`config.js`**, at the root of the repo. To change
something (say, the exact coordinates, or Celsius→Fahrenheit):

1. Edit `config.js` on GitHub (or locally, then `git push`).
2. Push it to the `main` branch.
3. Cloudflare redeploys automatically within about a minute.
4. The tablet picks it up the next time it reloads (at most, by the next 3am auto-reload).

No app store, no manual install, no touching the tablet at all.
